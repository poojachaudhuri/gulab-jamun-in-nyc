I'm from India and I love gulab jamuns. This project is my quest to find gulab jamuns - the best and the cheapest options - in New York City.

### Methodology

1. I scraped Yelp data from its API to get the restaurants that sell gulab jamuns. There weren't a lot -- 47 establishments. The API got me the names of the restaurants, location and rating.

2. I manually got the price of gulab jamuns by checking the menus of each restaurants. Sadly the API did not have an option to get menu details. In restaurants where the serving size is not specified, the cost is assumed to be for two gulab jamuns. For restaurants that sell the dessert by weight, 1lb is assumed to have 7 pieces of gulab jamun. 

2. Since I'm lazy and do not want to travel every time I have a gulab jamun craving, I also manually searched for canned gulab jamun on Amazon. The lowest price was considered for the same product sold by different sellers.
